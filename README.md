# 👋 Hi, I’m Pramod Barkade

**AI Engineer & IT Professional**  
Real-world systems • Cloud • Applied AI

I work with production systems, cloud platforms, and applied AI.  
This GitHub profile documents projects, experiments, and practical notes based on hands-on experience with real-world software and AI-driven systems.

The focus here is on how concepts translate into working systems, including design choices, trade-offs, and implementation details commonly encountered in production environments.

## 🧠 Areas of Focus

- Real-world software and system development  
- Cloud platforms and backend architectures  
- Applied AI and Generative AI use cases  
- Production-oriented experiments and prototypes  
- Practical technical learnings and references

## 🎯 Approach

I believe effective systems are built by:
- Strong understanding of fundamentals  
- Designing with real-world constraints in mind  
- Balancing correctness, performance, and maintainability  

The repositories here reflect this applied, system-focused approach.
